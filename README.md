## Getting and Cleaning of Human Activity Data from Smartphones
***

This repository contains the final requirement for the Peer-graded Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course offered by John Hopkins University. The repository contains the R script, a codebook, and the Tidy data set in .txt file.


### Description of Files
***

**run_Analysis.R** is the R script that is used to perform the instruction derived from the project requirement which states that the R script should perform the following:

> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
>5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**CodeBook.md** describes the procedures and variables relevant in cleaning the obtained human activity data.

**TidyData.text** refers to the exported final data obtained from running the R script.
